Kernel repacker made by Liliniser / dkcldark

Can not guarantee if this will work on every zImages.


usage : ./editor.sh [kernel] [initramfs_directory / file] [gz/lzma/""]

example : ./editor.sh  /home/zero/Desktop/test/zImage  /home/zero/Desktop/ramdisk-dir lzma
1. [kernel] : the place where your zImage file is
2. [initramfs_directory / file] : the place where your initramfs folder or a compressed file of the initramfs is
   (when you choose a compressed file of the initramfs, you don't need [gz or lzma], just leave it
3. [gz/lzma/""] : When you choose a directory of the initramfs, you need to specify the way how you
   want to compress your initramfs directory. ("" means just leave it!)

FROYO : supports both lzma and gzip compressions
ECLAIR : only supports gzip compression

you should let this editor where your cross-compiler is
